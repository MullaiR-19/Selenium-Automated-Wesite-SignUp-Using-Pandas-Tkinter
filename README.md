# Selenium-Automated-Wesite-SignUp-Using-Pandas-Tkinter
In this project we are automating a website's SignUp for multiple user from csv data using selenium with Tkinter, pathlib, time, math, pandas.

With a simple GUI we are calling and csv file  and reading the values using Pandas with the help of Selenium module we are accessing the browser of the Window system loading the sign up page finding the elements for input passing the values from the CSP file 1 by 1 with the Pandas module to the inputs of the sign up page and creating a new sign up for the website. 

In the process manually we are in selecting the csv file which contains the required data for sign up. 

Once a CSE file is selected we have to click the start button to start the browsers once the start button is pressed for each seven seconds a new sign up will be made.
*Incase of single missing data in the CSV file that specific row will be skipped.

*For customising replace the website URL and elements path in HTML.
